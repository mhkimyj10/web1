  as the Internet, or a private local area network (LAN), by referencing a uniform
  resource locator (URL) that identifies the site.</p>

  can be a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website,
  an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular

  its employees, are typically a part of an intranet.</p>
